I recently found the https://quicklatex.com/ website, which allows users to compile LaTeX code into SVG images. I thought it would be interesting to create a similar service using Python and Flask. This project consists of a Python-based server that receives LaTeX fragments, compiles them into a standalone document, converts the result into an SVG file, and returns it. Additionally, it includes a command-line utility to interact with the server. The Bonus is that the entire code base is generated by CHAT GPT-4o. The following prompts were used to generate the code:

server.py:

> write a python based server that accepts a request containing a fragment of latex - assume it is some few lines that would be in the document section of a typical latex document. The request may also supply some additional header \usepackage statements or macros that will be define. We should assume a standalone document type. Assume that the server is linux based, and has a standard, complete texlive installation on it, and typical latex commands and standard linux commandline utilities are available. The server should compile the latex fragment, convert the result into an SVG file, and return it.

client.py:

> write a commandline utility in python to use the server above

# LaTeX Compilation Server and Client

This project consists of a Python-based server that receives LaTeX fragments, compiles them into a standalone document, converts the result into an SVG file, and returns it. Additionally, it includes a command-line utility to interact with the server.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- requests
- A complete TeX Live distribution
- pdf2svg utility

## Installation

First, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```sh
pip install Flask requests
```

You should also have a complete TeX Live installation and the `pdf2svg` utility on your Linux server:

```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive-full pdf2svg
```

## Server

### Description

The LaTeX server (`latex_server.py`) accepts HTTP POST requests containing LaTeX fragments and optional preamble. It compiles the LaTeX code into a PDF and converts the PDF to SVG, which is then returned to the client.

### Usage

To start the server, run:

```sh
python latex_server.py
```

### API Endpoint

- **Endpoint**: `/compile`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**: JSON
  - `fragment` (string, required): The LaTeX fragment to compile.
  - `preamble` (string, optional): Additional preamble, including `\usepackage` statements or macros.
- **Response**: The compiled SVG image or an error message.

### Example JSON Payload

```json
{
  "fragment": "$x^2 + y^2 = 1$",
  "preamble": "\\usepackage{amsmath}"
}
```

## Client

### Description

The client (`latex_client.py`) is a command-line utility that reads LaTeX content from specified files, sends it to the LaTeX server for compilation, and saves the resulting SVG file.

### Usage

Command syntax:

```sh
python latex_client.py fragment_file [options]
```

- `fragment_file`: Path to the file containing the LaTeX fragment.
- Options:
  - `-p`, `--preamble_file`: Path to the file containing additional LaTeX preamble (optional).
  - `-o`, `--output`: Output SVG file name (default: `output.svg`).
  - `--url`: URL of the LaTeX compilation server (default: `http://localhost:5000/compile`).

### Example Usage

To compile a LaTeX fragment with an optional preamble:

```sh
python latex_client.py fragment.tex -p preamble.tex -o output.svg
```

To compile a LaTeX fragment without preamble:

```sh
python latex_client.py fragment.tex -o output.svg
```

### Sample Files

#### fragment.tex

```latex
x^2 + y^2 = 1
```

#### preamble.tex

```latex
\usepackage{amsmath}
```

## Code Explanation

### Server (`latex_server.py`)

This script creates a Flask server with a single endpoint `/compile` that accepts POST requests and processes LaTeX content.

1. **Flask Application**:

   - The Flask app is set up with one route `/compile` that handles POST requests.

2. **Temporary Directory**:

   - The LaTeX input is written to a temporary `.tex` file.

3. **Subprocess Calls**:

   - `pdflatex` compiles the `.tex` file into a `.pdf`.
   - `pdf2svg` converts the PDF to SVG.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If any subprocess call fails, the server returns the error details.

### Client (`latex_client.py`)

This script is a command-line tool that reads LaTeX content from files, sends it to the server, and saves the resulting SVG.

1. **Argument Parsing**:

   - Command-line arguments for the LaTeX fragment file, optional preamble file, output file, and server URL are defined using `argparse`.

2. **File Reading**:

   - The LaTeX fragment and optional preamble are read from the specified files.

3. **HTTP Request**:

   - The JSON payload with the LaTeX content is sent to the server using a POST request from the `requests` library.

4. **Handling the Response**:
   - The serverâ€™s response (SVG data) is saved to the specified output file.
